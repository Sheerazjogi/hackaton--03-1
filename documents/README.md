## Documents: Day 1 to Day 6

These are my **Documents** from **Day 1 to Day 6**, where I’ve documented my daily progress during the Hackathon.
Each day, I’ve provided details about the tasks I’ve completed, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
This documentation serves as a comprehensive record of my journey and progress throughout the Hackathon,
showcasing the work done at each stage.
